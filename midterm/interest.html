            <p>
                When I'm not doing school work or working, I like to do
                programming in my free time. While I haven't released anything,
                I do have many prototypes. Listed below are a couple of projects
                I'm more proud of compared to others:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <img src="assets/civtest.png" alt="Screenshot from the
                        untitled rts, consisting of a player on a large grass
                        field with many enemies">
                    An untitled real time strategy game written in Java from
                    the ground up using LWJGL. While the game currently isn't
                    anything to  write home about, what I've been focusing on
                    in it is a custom game engine dubbed "Colibris."
                    <br class="clearRight">
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="assets/viewermc.png" alt="Screenshot from
                        ViewerMC, showing a view from inside of a cave">
                    The start of an external Minecraft map editor. Using the
                    same engine mentioned previously, this program can render
                    maps and do very basic map manipulation.
                    <br class="clearRight">
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="assets/imagetomap.png" alt="The top portion of the
                        image shows the program, while the bottom portion shows
                        the ingame result rendered onto a map">
                    Another Minecraft related project, this is the most recent
                    larger project I've been working on. It allows importing
                    images, editing them, and then exporting them to a format
                    that can be imported into the game. Currently, the only
                    supported way is to use the mod 
                    <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica">Litematica</a>.
                    <br class="clearRight">
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="assets/wiring.png" alt="Screenshot from Wiring,
                        showing a basic circut; a lever wires into a gate,
                        which then wires into a lamp">
                    Made in ROBLOX and titled "Wiring", this project in its
                    current state allows you to create basic circuts and
                    interact with them using some select IO components.
