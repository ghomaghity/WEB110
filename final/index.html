                Before we go over the differences and similarities between Java and
                JavaScript, let's first go over the history of each and why they relate at all.

                    Back in 1991, a group of 13 people was hired by Sun Microsystems
                    to anticipate and plan for the "next wave" in computing. What they
                    came up with was a device called the *7 (StarSeven), a handheld home-entertainment
                    device. This device ran on an entirely new, processor-independent language,
                    "Oak." Oak would then be renamed to Java shortly after. In early 1995, a demo of what
                    would later be known as the HotJava browser would be shown at a TED
                    Conference, sparking interest in Java. Later that year, Java would
                    release a "full public" alpha build.

                    In 1995, Netscape noticed something: the web needed
                    to be more dynamic. To solve this, they hired Brendan Eich to implement
                    the Scheme language into their browser, Netscape. Before he could get started,
                    Netscape collaborated with Sun to include Java. Netscape saw having both
                    Java and a scripting language as a positive, describing Java as the
                    "component language" used by higher-priced programmers, and the
                    scripting language to be used to assemble components and automate
                    interactions. Netscape had decided that a scripting language should have
                    a syntax similar to Java's, which ruled out some existing languages.
                    The first iteration of this new language was called "Mocha." After
                    continuous development and a couple more name changes, the now large
                    language would be renamed again to its final name, JavaScript.
